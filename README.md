# About lead tracker

Lead tracker is a Chrome extension that is designed to store and display url's of potential leads/sources from around the web. It works much in the same way as the typical 'bookmark' function in most web browsers.

The difference with Lead Tracker is that you can easily store a list of useful leads or urls with a single click of a button which it will save the list locally.

## How it works

When you click on the lead tracker extension icon, you can click on the 'save' button which will save any manually inputted urls typed into the text field.

You can save multiple urls and they will be added to the list. You can clear the list at any time by clicking the 'delete all' button. This will also wipe the leads from your browser's local storage.

The 'save tab' button will automatically pull the url of the current tab
you're viewing and save it to localStorage
